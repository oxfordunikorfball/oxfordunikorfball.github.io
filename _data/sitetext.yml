    heading: "OU Korfball Club"
    body: "
    The Oxford University Korfball Club was established just over 30 years ago, making it the oldest university korfball club in the country and the oldest korfball club outright in Oxfordshire. 
    The rounded nature of the sport means our club ranges from freshers to staff and community members, and is **fully inclusive gender-wise**. 
    We're a friendly and sociable club, but a competitive one too. 
    We play in the weekly Oxfordshire league matches, the inter-university BUCS tournaments and Varsity matches against Cambridge every year.
    <br><br>
    Most of our players have **never** played Korfball before coming to Oxford and we're a club who care a lot about being as inclusive as possible for beginners so don't worry if you're not sure whether it's your sport for definite, just come and give it a try!
    "
    heading2: "What is Korfball?"
    body2: "
    Korfball is the Dutch cousin of basketball and netball. 
    It's a mixed-gender sport which is all about tactics and teamwork, and less about how tall you are! 
    Movement with the ball is less limited than netball and although you can shoot from anywhere on the pitch, importantly, players cannot shoot if closely marked. 
    The team must therefore work together to create space in order to score. 
    Teams consist of eight people and switch between attackers and defenders every two goals: players need to be confident in both positions. 
    Korfball is inclusive to everyone, regardless of experience, and we welcome enquiries from those with a disability regarding the accessibility of Korfball.
